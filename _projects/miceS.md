    We aged a cohort of 50 AKR/J female mice until their death from natural causes (APAFIS #18333-2018112915281820v6) and measured, every 3-4 weeks (represented by the vertical arrows), intetsinal permeability, body composition, behavioural parameters, ...

When re-aligned on the date of death instead of the date of birth, i.e. physiological vs chronological ages, ALL the parameters behave in biphasic manner, thus confirming our initial hypothesis.
