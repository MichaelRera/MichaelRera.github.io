<p>Ageing is a complex process for which multiple genetic regulators have been identified in the past 30 years. Yet, the very mechanisms driving ageing have not been identified.</p>

<p>Using the broadly evolutionarily conserved and molecularly stereotyped Smurf transition, we develop an original approach for inferring the gene regulatory networks changes occuring during ageing and at the Smurf transition.</p>

<p>The project will focus on applying network approaches to understand and <b>model the dynamics of gene networks driving ageing</b> in Drosophila and Humans. In particular, the project will focus on describing ageing as a propagation of network failures in the multi-layer interactome. The project is supported by a French national ANR JCJC funding (<a href="https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-20-CE44-0010">ADAGIO</a>).</p>
