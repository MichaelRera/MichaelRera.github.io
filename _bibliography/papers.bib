  abstract = {Human ageing, along with the ageing of conventional model organisms, is depicted as a continuous and progressive decline of biological capabilities accompanied by an exponentially increasing mortality risk. However, not all organisms experience ageing identically and our understanding of the phenomenon is coloured by human-centric views. Ageing is multifaceted and influences a diverse range of species in varying ways. Some undergo swift declines post-reproduction, while others exhibit insubstantial changes throughout their existence. This vast array renders defining universally applicable “ageing attributes” a daunting task. It is nonetheless essential to recognize that not all ageing features are organism-specific. These common attributes have paved the way for identifying “hallmarks of ageing,” processes that are intertwined with age, amplified during accelerated ageing, and manipulations of which can potentially modulate or even reverse the ageing process. Yet, a glaring observation is that individuals within a single population age at varying rates. To address this, demographers have coined the term ‘frailty’. Concurrently, scientific advancements have ushered in the era of molecular clocks. These innovations enable a distinction between an individual’s chronological age (time since birth) and biological age (physiological status and mortality risk). In 2011, the “Smurf” phenotype was unveiled in Drosophila, delineating an age-linked escalation in intestinal permeability that presages imminent mortality. It not only acts as a predictor of natural death but identifies individuals exhibiting traits normally described as age-related. Subsequent studies have revealed the phenotype in organisms like nematodes, zebrafish, and mice, invariably acting as a death predictor. Collectively, these findings have steered our conception of ageing towards a framework where ageing is not linear and continuous but marked by two distinct, necessary phases, discernible in vivo, courtesy of the Smurf phenotype. This framework includes a mathematical enunciation of longevity trends based on three experimentally measurable parameters. It facilitates a fresh perspective on the evolution of ageing as a function. In this article, we aim to delineate and explore the foundational principles of this innovative framework, emphasising its potential to reshape our understanding of ageing, challenge its conventional definitions, and recalibrate our comprehension of its evolutionary trajectory.}

  abstract = {Since being described in Drosophila melanogaster in 2011, the Smurf phenotype, has been seen to be evolutionarily conserved in nematode and zebrafish, and has helped to identify the discontinuous nature of ageing and predict impending death from natural causes as well as from environmental stresses. This phenotype allowed us to model ageing as being made of two successive phases : a phase A where individuals are healthy and have no risk of mortality but an age-dependent increasing risk of entering phase B, followed by a phase B where individuals show the so-called hallmarks of ageing and a high risk of death. We will test here whether these two consecutive phases of ageing separated by the Smurf transition are a conserved feature of ageing in the classical mammalian laboratory model Mus musculus. Thanks to a longitudinal longevity study using both males and females from two different mouse genetic backgrounds and by integrating physiological, metabolic and molecular measurements with the life history of approximately 150 mice, we are attempting to identify a phenotypic signature typical of the last phase of life, observable at any chronological age. Validating the two-phase ageing model in a mammalian organism would allow the high risk of imminent death to be better characterized in this model and would extend its implications to a broader range of species for aging research. }

  abstract = {Cuticle pigmentation has been clearly demonstrated to impact body temperature for several relatively large species of insects, but it was questioned for small insects. Here we used a thermal camera to assess the impact of drosophilid cuticle pigmentation on body temperature when individuals are exposed to light. We compared mutants of large effects within species (Drosophila melanogaster ebony and yellow mutants). Then we analyzed the impact of naturally occurring pigmentation variation within species complexes (Drosophila americana/Drosophila novamexicana and Drosophila yakuba/Drosophila santomea). Finally we analyzed lines of D. melanogaster with moderate differences in pigmentation. We found significant differences in temperatures for each of the four pairs we analyzed. The temperature differences appeared to be proportional to the differently pigmented area: between Drosophila melanogaster ebony and yellow mutants or between Drosophila americana and Drosophila novamexicana, for which the whole body is differently pigmented, the difference in temperatures was around 0.6 (p/m 0.2) Celsius degrees. By contrast, between D. yakuba and D. santomea or between Drosophila melanogaster Dark and Pale lines, for which only the posterior abdomen is differentially pigmented, we detected a temperature difference of about 0.14 (p/m 0.10) Celsius degrees. This demonstrates that cuticle pigmentation has ecological implications in drosophilids regarding adaptation to environmental temperature.},

abstract = {Abstract Ageing is characterised at the molecular level by six transcriptional ‘hallmarks of ageing’, that are commonly described as progressively affected as time passes. By contrast, the ‘Smurf’ assay separates high-and-constant-mortality risk individuals from healthy, zero-mortality risk individuals, based on increased intestinal permeability. Performing whole body total RNA sequencing, we found that Smurfness distinguishes transcriptional changes associated with chronological age from those associated with biological age. We show that transcriptional heterogeneity increases with chronological age in non-Smurf individuals preceding the other five hallmarks of ageing that are specifically associated with the Smurf state. Using this approach, we also devise targeted pro-longevity genetic interventions delaying entry in the Smurf state. We anticipate that increased attention to the evolutionary conserved Smurf phenotype will bring about significant advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of ageing.}
